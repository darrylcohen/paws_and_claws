PAWS AND CLAWS

This was a prime example of totally designing to build a table and end up building a tree becaue of changing my mind as I was coding

- Paws and Claws is an appo designed to be used in house by the staff who work there
- It has many shelters across australia
- There are 2 types of users
  - Normal access
    - Staff can enter adoptions and returns but only for the shelter they belong to. EG, a person who works in melbourne will only see the melbourne shelter
  - Admin
    - Admin people can add new animals and clients and can do adoptions where the animal has to be sent across the country

What I learnt
- I got a lot of experience how to write the same functionality 10000000 times and then when adding something have to change 10000000 times
- The flow through the web
- That I still struggle with CSS

Take Aways
- A good app idea would be to have an app for peer to peer communication

What I would do differently on the next app
- Understand 100% what the business requirements are
- Spend more time on the design
- DONT CHANGE MY MIND HALF WAY THROUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!

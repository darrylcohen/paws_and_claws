Paws and Claws is an app designed to be used in house by the staff who work in the Shelters across Australia. The purpose of the app is to allow clients to adopt animals and return animal

#### Design
[ERD and Wire Frames](https://github.com/darrylcohen/paws_and_claws/blob/master/Sheters.pdf)


#### Using the app
1. Logon as Admin: Email = 'dabc', password = 'darryl', branch = 'Melbourne'

### What I learnt
1. I got a lot of experience how to write the same functionality 10000000 times and then when adding something have to change 10000000 times
2. Spend more time defining the business requirements and the design of the wireframes
3. Got good knowledge of using Sinartra, Active Record and RElational Databases

#### Take Aways
A good app idea would be to have an app for peer to peer adoption of animals

#### What I would do differently on the next app
1. Understand 100% what the business requirements are
2. Spend more time on the design
3. DONT CHANGE MY MIND HALF WAY THROUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!
4. This was a prime example of totally designing to build a table and end up building a tree because of changing my mind as I was coding

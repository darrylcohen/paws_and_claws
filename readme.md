#### Design
[ERD and Wire Frames](https://github.com/darrylcohen/paws_and_claws/blob/master/Sheters.pdf)

#### Users
There are 2 types of users
1. Normal access
   Staff can enter adoptions and returns but only for the shelter they have access to. EG, a person who works in                melbourne will only see the melbourne shelter
2. Admin
   Admin people can add new animals and clients and can do adoptions across Shelters

#### Using the app
1. Logon as Admin: Email = 'dabc', password = 'darryl, branch = 'Melbourne'
2. Once logged on go to Maintenance > User Access and s

### What I learnt
1. I got a lot of experience how to write the same functionality 10000000 times and then when adding something have to change 10000000 times
2. Spend more time defining the business requirements and the design of the wireframes
3. Got good knowledge of using Sinartra, Active Record and RElational Databases

#### Take Aways
A good app idea would be to have an app for peer to peer adoption of animals

#### What I would do differently on the next app
1. Understand 100% what the business requirements are
2. Spend more time on the design
3. DONT CHANGE MY MIND HALF WAY THROUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!
4. This was a prime example of totally designing to build a table and end up building a tree because of changing my mind as I was coding
